                <p>Egypt — a poem written by the sands of time,
                    Where the sun rises over golden dunes and ancient stones.
                    The Nile sings a lullaby to the hearts of its people,
                    And the pyramids stand like proud guardians of history.
                    In every breeze, you feel whispers of pharaohs,
                    In every sunset, a story painted in the colors of eternity.
                    Egypt is not just a place — it is a heartbeat,
                    A soul that dances between the past and the forever</p>

                        century BC. In a remarkable feat of modern engineering, the entire complex was relocated in the 1960s to save it from the rising

                     <h3>Alexandria Corniche</h3>
                     <p class="card-description">The Alexandria Corniche is the heartbeat of the city, stretching gracefully 
                        along the Mediterranean Sea. Lined with palm trees, historic buildings, and cozy cafés, it’s the perfect 
                        place for a peaceful walk or to enjoy the sea breeze. By day, it’s full of life with families, vendors, 
                        and the sound of waves. By night, the city lights reflect on the water, creating a magical view. 
                        The Corniche is more than just a road — it’s a place where the sea meets the soul of Alexandria.
